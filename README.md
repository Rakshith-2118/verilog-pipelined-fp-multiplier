# 16-Bit Pipelined Floating-Point Multiplier in Verilog

[![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)

This repository contains the Verilog source code for a high-performance, 16-bit half-precision floating-point multiplier. The design is fully pipelined and includes a comprehensive self-checking testbench for verification.

## Key Features üéØ

* **3-Stage Pipelined Architecture**: The multiplier breaks the logic into three smaller stages (Decode/Multiply, Normalize, Round/Assemble) to increase throughput[cite: 1]. [cite_start]It has a 3-cycle latency but allows a new operation to begin every clock cycle[cite: 2].
* **Overflow & Underflow Detection**: The module includes robust logic to detect when the result is too large (overflow) or too small (underflow) to be represented[cite: 3]. [cite_start]The result is clamped to infinity or zero, and corresponding flags are set[cite: 4].
* **High-Accuracy Rounding**: Implements a precise "**Round to Nearest, Tie to Even**" rounding scheme to minimize numerical error, offering better accuracy than simple truncation[cite: 5, 29].
* **Self-Checking Testbench**: The included testbench automatically verifies the multiplier's output against a set of predefined expected results[cite: 43]. [cite_start]It reports a `[PASS]` or `[FAIL]` status for each test case, making verification straightforward[cite: 48, 68].

## Hardware Design (RTL) ‚öôÔ∏è

The core of this project is the `FloatingPoint_Multiplier_Complete.v` module. [cite_start]It implements the multiplier based on the **16-bit half-precision floating-point format** (1-bit sign, 5-bit exponent, 10-bit mantissa)[cite: 6].

The operation is divided into three pipeline stages:

1.  **Stage 1: Decode & Multiply**: This stage deconstructs the two 16-bit inputs (`a` and `b`) into their sign, exponent, and mantissa components[cite: 14, 16]. [cite_start]It performs the initial multiplication of the mantissas and calculates the new sign and exponent[cite: 19, 20, 21].
2.  **Stage 2: Normalize**: The product from Stage 1 is normalized[cite: 22]. [cite_start]If the most significant bit of the product is set, the mantissa is shifted right and the exponent is incremented to bring the result back into the standard `1.xxx` format[cite: 25, 26].
3.  **Stage 3: Round & Assemble**: This final stage applies the "Round to Nearest, Tie to Even" logic to the normalized mantissa[cite: 29]. [cite_start]It also performs the final overflow and underflow checks[cite: 37, 38, 39]. [cite_start]Finally, it assembles the sign, exponent, and mantissa into the final 16-bit result[cite: 40].

## How to Simulate üíª

This project was originally developed and verified using **Xilinx ISE**, but it's written in standard Verilog and should be compatible with most simulators.

1.  **Get a Verilog Simulator**: You can use any standard Verilog simulator, such as Icarus Verilog (open-source), ModelSim, or the simulators included with Vivado or Quartus.
2.  **Compile the Files**: Compile both `FloatingPoint_Multiplier_Complete.v` and `self_checking_tb.v`.
3.  **Run the Simulation**: Set `tb_FloatingPoint_Multiplier_Complete_SelfCheck` as the top-level module for the simulation and run it. The testbench will automatically execute the test sequence and print the results to the console.
